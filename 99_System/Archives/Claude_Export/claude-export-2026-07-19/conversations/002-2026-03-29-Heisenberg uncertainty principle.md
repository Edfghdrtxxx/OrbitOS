      "text": "# Imagine — Visual Creation Suite\n\n## Modules\nCall read_me again with the modules parameter to load detailed guidance:\n- `diagram` — SVG flowcharts, structural diagrams, illustrative diagrams\n- `mockup` — UI mockups, forms, cards, dashboards\n- `interactive` — interactive explainers with controls\n- `chart` — charts, data analysis, geographic maps (Chart.js, D3 choropleth)\n- `art` — illustration and generative art\nPick the closest fit. The module includes all relevant design guidance.\n\n**Complexity budget — hard limits:**\n- Box subtitles: ≤5 words. Detail goes in click-through (`sendPrompt`) or the prose below — not the box.\n- Colors: ≤2 ramps per diagram. If colors encode meaning (states, tiers), add a 1-line legend. Otherwise use one neutral ramp.\n- Horizontal tier: ≤4 boxes at full width (~140px each). 5+ boxes → shrink to ≤110px OR wrap to 2 rows OR split into overview + detail diagrams.\n\nIf you catch yourself writing \"click to learn more\" in prose, the diagram itself must ACTUALLY be sparse. Don't promise brevity then front-load everything.\n\nYou create rich visual content — SVG diagrams/illustrations and HTML interactive widgets — that renders inline in conversation. The best output feels like a natural extension of the chat.\n\n## Core Design System\n\nThese rules apply to ALL use cases.\n\n### Philosophy\n- **Seamless**: Users shouldn't notice where claude.ai ends and your widget begins.\n- **Flat**: No gradients, mesh backgrounds, noise textures, or decorative effects. Clean flat surfaces.\n- **Compact**: Show the essential inline. Explain the rest in text.\n- **Text goes in your response, visuals go in the tool** — All explanatory text, descriptions, introductions, and summaries must be written as normal response text OUTSIDE the tool call. The tool output should contain ONLY the visual element (diagram, chart, interactive widget). Never put paragraphs of explanation, section headings, or descriptive prose inside the HTML/SVG. If the user asks \"explain X\", write the explanation in your response and use the tool only for the visual that accompanies it. The user's font settings only apply to your response text, not to text inside the widget.\n\n### Streaming\nOutput streams token-by-token. Structure code so useful content appears early.\n- **HTML**: `<style>` (short) → content HTML → `<script>` last.\n- **SVG**: `<defs>` (markers) → visual elements immediately.\n- Prefer inline `style=\"...\"` over `<style>` blocks — inputs/controls must look correct mid-stream.\n- Keep `<style>` under ~15 lines. Interactive widgets with inputs and sliders need more style rules — that's fine, but don't bloat with decorative CSS.\n- Gradients, shadows, and blur flash during streaming DOM diffs. Use solid flat fills instead.\n\n### Rules\n- No `<!-- comments -->` or `/* comments */` (waste tokens, break streaming)\n- No font-size below 11px\n- No emoji — use CSS shapes or SVG paths\n- No gradients, drop shadows, blur, glow, or neon effects\n- No dark/colored backgrounds on outer containers (transparent only — host provides the bg)\n- **Typography**: The default font is Anthropic Sans. For the rare editorial/blockquote moment, use `font-family: var(--font-serif)`.\n- **Headings**: h1 = 22px, h2 = 18px, h3 = 16px — all `font-weight: 500`. Heading color is pre-set to `var(--color-text-primary)` — don't override it. Body text = 16px, weight 400, `line-height: 1.7`. **Two weights only: 400 regular, 500 bold.** Never use 600 or 700 — they look heavy against the host UI.\n- **Sentence case** always. Never Title Case, never ALL CAPS. This applies everywhere including SVG text labels and diagram headings.\n- **No mid-sentence bolding**, including in your response text around the tool call. Entity names, class names, function names go in `code style` not **bold**. Bold is for headings and labels only.\n- The widget container is `display: block; width: 100%`. Your HTML fills it naturally — no wrapper div needed. Just start with your content directly. If you want vertical breathing room, add `padding: 1rem 0` on your first element.\n- Never use `position: fixed` — the iframe viewport sizes itself to your in-flow content height, so fixed-positioned elements (modals, overlays, tooltips) collapse it to `min-height: 100px`. For modal/overlay mockups: wrap everything in a normal-flow `<div style=\"min-height: 400px; background: rgba(0,0,0,0.45); display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center;\">` and put the modal inside — it's a faux viewport that actually contributes layout height.\n- No DOCTYPE, `<html>`, `<head>`, or `<body>` — just content fragments.\n- When placing text on a colored background (badges, pills, cards, tags), use the darkest shade from that same color family for the text — never plain black or generic gray.\n- **Corners**: use `border-radius: var(--border-radius-md)` (or `-lg` for cards) in HTML. In SVG, `rx=\"4\"` is the default — larger values make pills, use only when you mean a pill.\n- **No rounded corners on single-sided borders** — if using `border-left` or `border-top` accents, set `border-radius: 0`. Rounded corners only work with full borders on all sides.\n- **No titles or prose inside the tool output** — see Philosophy above.\n- **Icon sizing**: When using emoji or inline SVG icons, explicitly set `font-size: 16px` for emoji or `width: 16px; height: 16px` for SVG icons. Never let icons inherit the container's font size — they will render too large. For larger decorative icons, use 24px max.\n- No tabs, carousels, or `display: none` sections during streaming — hidden content streams invisibly. Show all content stacked vertically. (Post-streaming JS-driven steppers are fine — see Illustrative/Interactive sections.)\n- No nested scrolling — auto-fit height.\n- Scripts execute after streaming — load libraries via `<script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/...\">` (UMD globals), then use the global in a plain `<script>` that follows.\n- **CDN allowlist (CSP-enforced)**: external resources may ONLY load from `cdnjs.cloudflare.com`, `esm.sh`, `cdn.jsdelivr.net`, `unpkg.com`. All other origins are blocked by the sandbox — the request silently fails.\n\n### CSS Variables\n**Backgrounds**: `--color-background-primary` (white), `-secondary` (surfaces), `-tertiary` (page bg), `-info`, `-danger`, `-success`, `-warning`\n**Text**: `--color-text-primary` (black), `-secondary` (muted), `-tertiary` (hints), `-info`, `-danger`, `-success`, `-warning`\n**Borders**: `--color-border-tertiary` (0.15α, default), `-secondary` (0.3α, hover), `-primary` (0.4α), semantic `-info/-danger/-success/-warning`\n**Typography**: `--font-sans`, `--font-serif`, `--font-mono`\n**Layout**: `--border-radius-md` (8px), `--border-radius-lg` (12px — preferred for most components), `--border-radius-xl` (16px)\nAll auto-adapt to light/dark mode. For custom colors in HTML, use CSS variables.\n\n**Dark mode is mandatory** — every color must work in both modes:\n- In SVG: use the pre-built color classes (`c-blue`, `c-teal`, `c-amber`, etc.) for colored nodes — they handle light/dark mode automatically. Never write `<style>` blocks for colors.\n- In SVG: every `<text>` element needs a class (`t`, `ts`, `th`) — never omit fill or use `fill=\"inherit\"`. Inside a `c-{color}` parent, text classes auto-adjust to the ramp.\n- In HTML: always use CSS variables (--color-text-primary, --color-text-secondary) for text. Never hardcode colors like color: #333 — invisible in dark mode.\n- Mental test: if the background were near-black, would every text element still be readable?\n\n### sendPrompt(text)\nA global function that sends a message to chat as if the user typed it. Use it when the user's next step benefits from Claude thinking. Handle filtering, sorting, toggling, and calculations in JS instead.\n\n### Links\n`<a href=\"https://...\">` just works — clicks are intercepted and open the host's link-confirmation dialog. Or call `openLink(url)` directly.\n\n## When nothing fits\nPick the closest use case below and adapt. When nothing fits cleanly:\n- Default to editorial layout if the content is explanatory\n- Default to card layout if the content is a bounded object\n- All core design system rules still apply\n- Use `sendPrompt()` for any action that benefits from Claude thinking\n\n\n## SVG setup\n\n**ViewBox safety checklist** — before finalizing any SVG, verify:\n1. Find your lowest element: max(y + height) across all rects, max(y) across all text baselines.\n2. Set viewBox height = that value + 40px buffer.\n3. Find your rightmost element: max(x + width) across all rects. All content must stay within x=0 to x=680.\n4. For text with text-anchor=\"end\", the text extends LEFT from x. If x=118 and text is 200px wide, it starts at x=-82 — outside the viewBox. Increase x or use text-anchor=\"start\".\n5. Never use negative x or y coordinates. The viewBox starts at 0,0.\n6. Flowcharts/structural only: for every pair of boxes in the same row, check that the left box's (x + width) is less than the right box's x by at least 20px. If four 160px boxes plus three 20px gaps sum to more than 640px, the row doesn't fit — shrink the boxes or cut the subtitles, don't let them overlap.\n\n**SVG setup**: `<svg width=\"100%\" viewBox=\"0 0 680 H\">` — 680px wide, flexible height. Set H to fit content tightly — the last element's bottom edge + 40px padding. Don't leave excess empty space below the content. Safe area: x=40 to x=640, y=40 to y=(H-40). Background transparent. **Do not wrap the SVG in a container `<div>` with a background color** — the widget host already provides the card container and background. Output the raw `<svg>` element directly.\n\n**The 680 in viewBox is load-bearing — do not change it.** It matches the widget container width so SVG coordinate units render 1:1 with CSS pixels. With `width=\"100%\"`, the browser scales the entire coordinate space to fit the container: `viewBox=\"0 0 480 H\"` in a 680px container scales everything by 680/480 = 1.42×, so your `class=\"th\"` 14px text renders at ~20px. The font calibration table below and all \"text fits in box\" math assume 1:1. If your diagram content is naturally narrow, **keep viewBox width at 680 and center the content** (e.g. content spans x=180..500) — do not shrink the viewBox to hug the content. This applies equally to inline SVGs inside HTML steppers and widgets: same `viewBox=\"0 0 680 H\"`, same 1:1 guarantee.\n\n**viewBox height:** After layout, find max_y (bottom-most point of any shape, including text baselines + 4px descent). Set viewBox height = max_y + 20. Don't guess.\n\n**text-anchor='end' at x<60 is risky** — the longest label will extend left past x=0. Use text-anchor='start' and right-align the column instead, or check: label_chars × 8 < anchor_x.\n\n**One SVG per tool call** — each call must contain exactly one <svg> element. Never leave an abandoned or partial SVG in the output. If your first attempt has problems, replace it entirely — do not append a corrected version after the broken one.\n\n**Style rules for all diagrams**:\n- Every `<text>` element must carry one of the pre-built classes (`t`, `ts`, `th`). An unclassed `<text>` inherits the default sans font, which is the tell that you forgot the class.\n- Use only two font sizes: 14px for node/region labels (class=\"t\" or \"th\"), 12px for subtitles, descriptions, and arrow labels (class=\"ts\"). No other sizes.\n- No decorative step numbers, large numbering, or oversized headings outside boxes.\n- No icons or illustrations inside boxes — text only. (Exception: illustrative diagrams may use simple shape-based indicators inside drawn objects — see below.)\n- Sentence case on all labels.\n\n**Font size calibration for diagram text labels** - Here's csv table to give you better sense of the Anthropic Sans font rendering width:\n```csv\ntext, chars length, font-weight, font-size, rendered width\nAuthentication Service, chars: 22, font-weight: 500, font-size: 14px, width: 167px\nBackground Job Processor, chars: 24, font-weight: 500, font-size: 14px, width: 201px\nDetects and validates incoming tokens, chars: 37, font-weight: 400, font-size: 14px, width: 279px\nforwards request to, chars: 19, font-weight: 400, font-size: 12px, width: 123px\nデータベースサーバー接続, chars: 12, font-weight: 400, font-size: 14px, width: 181px\n```\n\nBefore placing text in a box, check: does (text width + 2×padding) fit the container?\n\n**SVG `<text>` never auto-wraps.** Every line break needs an explicit `<tspan x=\"...\" dy=\"1.2em\">`. If your subtitle is long enough to need wrapping, it's too long — shorten it (see complexity budget).\n\n**Example check**: You want to put \"Glucose (C₆H₁₂O₆)\" in a rounded rect. The text is 20 characters at 14px ≈ 180px wide. Add 2×24px padding = 228px minimum box width. If your rect is only 160px wide, the text WILL overflow — either shorten the label (e.g. just \"Glucose\") or widen the box. Subscript characters like ₆ and ₁₂ still take horizontal space — count them.\n\n**Pre-built classes** (already loaded in SVG widget):\n- `class=\"t\"` = sans 14px primary, `class=\"ts\"` = sans 12px secondary, `class=\"th\"` = sans 14px medium (500)\n- `class=\"box\"` = neutral rect (bg-secondary fill, border stroke)\n- `class=\"node\"` = clickable group with hover effect (cursor pointer, slight dim on hover)\n- `class=\"arr\"` = arrow line (1.5px, open chevron head)\n- `class=\"leader\"` = dashed leader line (tertiary stroke, 0.5px, dashed)\n- `class=\"c-{ramp}\"` = colored node (c-blue, c-teal, c-amber, c-green, c-red, c-purple, c-coral, c-pink, c-gray). Apply to `<g>` or shape element (rect/circle/ellipse), NOT to paths. Sets fill+stroke on shapes, auto-adjusts child `t`/`ts`/`th`, dark mode automatic.\n\n**c-{ramp} nesting:** These classes use direct-child selectors (`>`). Nest a `<g>` inside a `<g class=\"c-blue\">` and the inner shapes become grandchildren — they lose the fill and render BLACK (SVG default). Put `c-*` on the innermost group holding the shapes, or on the shapes directly. If you need click handlers, put `onclick` on the `c-*` group itself, not a wrapper.\n\n- Short aliases: `var(--p)`, `var(--s)`, `var(--t)`, `var(--bg2)`, `var(--b)`\n- Arrow marker: always include this `<defs>` at the start of every SVG:\n  `<defs><marker id=\"arrow\" viewBox=\"0 0 10 10\" refX=\"8\" refY=\"5\" markerWidth=\"6\" markerHeight=\"6\" orient=\"auto-start-reverse\"><path d=\"M2 1L8 5L2 9\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"context-stroke\" stroke-width=\"1.5\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\"/></marker></defs>`\n  Then use `marker-end=\"url(#arrow)\"` on lines. The head uses `context-stroke`, so it inherits the colour of whichever line it sits on — a dashed green line gets a green head, a grey line gets a grey head. Never a colour mismatch. Do not add filters, patterns, or extra markers to `<defs>`. Illustrative diagrams may add a single `<clipPath>` or `<linearGradient>` (see Illustrative section).\n\n**Minimize standalone labels.** Every `<text>` element must be inside a box (title or ≤5-word subtitle) or in the legend. Arrow labels are usually unnecessary — if the arrow's meaning isn't obvious from its source + target, put it in the box subtitle or in prose below. Labels floating in space collide with things and are ambiguous.\n\n**Stroke width:** Use 0.5px strokes for diagram borders and edges — not 1px or 2px. Thin strokes feel more refined.\n\n**Connector paths need `fill=\"none\"`.** SVG defaults to `fill: black` — a curved connector without `fill=\"none\"` renders as a huge black shape instead of a clean line. Every `<path>` or `<polyline>` used as a connector/arrow MUST have `fill=\"none\"`. Only set fill on shapes meant to be filled (rects, circles, polygons).\n\n**Rect rounding:** `rx=\"4\"` for subtle corners. `rx=\"8\"` max for emphasized rounding. `rx` ≥ half the height = pill shape — deliberate only.\n\n**Schematic containers use dashed rects with a label.** Don't draw literal shapes (organelle ovals, cloud outlines, server tower icons) — the diagram is a schema, not an illustration. A dashed `<rect>` labeled \"Reactor vessel\" reads cleaner than an `<ellipse>` that clips content.\n\n**Lines stop at component edges.** When a line meets a component (wire into a bulb, edge into a node), draw it as segments that stop at the boundary — never draw through and rely on a fill to hide the line. The background color is not guaranteed; any occluding fill is a coupling. Compute the stop/start coordinates from the component's position and size.\n\n**Physical-color scenes (sky, water, grass, skin, materials):** Use ALL hardcoded hex — never mix with `c-*` theme classes. The scene should not invert in dark mode. If you need a dark variant, provide it explicitly with `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` — this is the one place that's allowed. Mixing hardcoded backgrounds with theme-responsive `c-*` foreground breaks: half inverts, half doesn't.\n\n**No rotated text**. `<defs>` may contain the arrow marker, a `<clipPath>`, and — in illustrative diagrams only — a single `<linearGradient>`. Nothing else: no filters, no patterns, no extra markers.\n\n\n## Art and illustration\n*\"Draw me a sunset\" / \"Create a geometric pattern\"*\n\nUse SVG. Same technical rules (viewBox, safe area) but the aesthetic is different:\n- Fill the canvas — art should feel rich, not sparse\n- Bold colors: mix `--color-text-*` categories for variety (info blue, success green, warning amber)\n- Art is the one place custom `<style>` color blocks are fine — freestyle colors, `prefers-color-scheme` for dark mode variants if you want them\n- Layer overlapping opaque shapes for depth\n- Organic forms with `<path>` curves, `<ellipse>`, `<circle>`\n- Texture via repetition (parallel lines, dots, hatching) not raster effects\n- Geometric patterns with `<g transform=\"rotate()\">` for radial symmetry\n",
